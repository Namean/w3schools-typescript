TypeScript support some simple types (primitives) you may know.



There are three main primitives in JavaScript and TypeScript.

- `boolean` - true or false values
- `number` - whole numbers and floating point values
- `string` - text values like "TypeScript Rocks"

There are alos 2 less common primitives used in later versions of JavaSCript and TypeScript.

- `bigint` - whole numbers and floating point values, but allows larger negative and postive numbers than the `number` type.

- `symbol` - are used to create a globally unique identifier.
