# TypeScript Tuples

- Typed Arrays
- Readonly Tuple


## Typed Arrays


A **tuple** is a typed array with a pre-defined length and types for each index.

Tuples are great because they allow each element in the array to be a known type of value.

To define a tuple, specify the type of each element in the array:

```ts
// define our tuple
let ourTuple: [number, boolean, string];

// initialize correctly
ourTuple = [5, false, 'Coding God was here'];
```

As you can see we have a number, boolean and a string. But what happens if we try to set them in the wrong order:

```ts
// define our tuple
let ourTuple: [number, boolean, string];

// initialized incorrectly which throws an error
ourTuple = [false, 'Coding God was mistaken', 5];
```


> Even though we have a `boolean`, `string`, and `number` the order matters in our tuple and will throw an error.

## Readonly Tuple

A good practice is to make your **tuple** `readonly`.

Tuples only have strongly defined types for the initial values:

```ts
// define our tuple
let ourTuple: [number, boolean, string];
// initialize correctly
ourTuple = [5, false, 'Coding God was here'];
// We have no type safety in our tuple for indexes 3+
ourTuple.push('Something new and wrong');
console.log(ourTuple);
```

You see the new valueTuples only have strongly defined types for the initial values:



```ts
// define our readonly tuple
const ourReadonlyTuple: readonly [number, boolean, string] = [5, true, 'The Real Coding God'];
// throws error as it is readonly.
ourReadonlyTuple.push('Coding God took a day off');
```
